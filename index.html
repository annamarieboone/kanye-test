	<p>I was raised in a virtuous home graced with the vocals of R&amp;B gods. We prayed to Marvin Gaye every morning, the Temptations every night. We had Wednesday bible study with Cool and the Gang and we gave worship every Sunday with Luther Vandross.</p>
	<p>I was set on the righteous path to loving R&amp;B and hip-hop early and it looked as though my future would be bright and promising.</p>
	<p>But like Eve, I stumbled upon my forbidden fruit and was lured from the holy path into the darkness of angsty alternative rock. It would be years until I saw the light again and I never thought I&rsquo;d be brought back by Yeezus himself.</p>
	<p>For years I told myself I hated Kanye West.</p>
	<p>Given, we had a bad first impression. Though I had been pretending to hate his songs like &ldquo;Gold Digger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stronger&rdquo; for years I didn&rsquo;t know who Kanye actually was until he interrupted Taylor Swift&rsquo;s 2009 VMA acceptance speech.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always hated the use of the N-word and Kanye and Jay Z became the face of advocacy to reclaim the term. Where they saw it as a way of taking that power away from white people, I saw an increase in white people using the word and they used Kanye as their &ldquo;black friend&rdquo; card. As far as I was concerned, he was setting us back by decades.</p>
		<p>But my biggest reason for hating Kanye lied more with myself. At 12 years old I was sporting some serious internal racism and I refused to allow myself to like anything associated with black people. This meant altering what I wore, the way I talked and the music I could listen to.</p>
		<p>The devil had me in his grasp and it looked like the end of the line for me.</p>
		<p>And then I went to college and met a special group of white people. Like angels they came to me in my time of need and they played the legendary gospel tunes of &ldquo;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At first, I refused to listen. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to be saved yet and they knew I would have to come to Yeezus at my own time.</p>
		<p>Little did we know, that time was approaching.</p>
		<p>Sept. 21, 2015 was the day my life changed forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>I was riding the bus home and I chose to listen to &ldquo;Monster.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>I was just nodding my head waiting for Nicki Minaj&rsquo;s verse when I heard the line, &ldquo;My presence is a present, kiss my ass.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>I replayed the song to hear it again and again and every time I did the pure exhaustion with human beings emanating from that single line resonated stronger within me. It was like the clouds parted and the sun rained down on me like the grace of God and I felt at peace for the first time in years as I accepted Yeezus into my heart.</p>

		<p>Kanye&rsquo;s albums are the books of his scripture and when I listened carefully he had a lot to teach me about him as a person and also about myself.</p>
		<p>Real talk: the confidence Kanye gave me is insurmountable.</p>
		<p>I don&rsquo;t just mean general confidence, which Kanye is the best at teaching. His motto is arrogance over modesty and if you listen to &ldquo;Last Call&rdquo; you can&rsquo;t fault him.</p>
		<p>It was the racial confidence he lent me that has made the biggest difference in my life.</p>
		<p>Kanye has a strong message of black pride and the way it shaped my racial identity at 21 has me permanently indebted to him. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>As progressive as Kanye is he actually brought me back to my roots. I&rsquo;m back on the righteous path and I can raise my hands to Marvin and Luther again so thank you, Yeezus.</p>

	<p class="bold">Dear Mr. West,</p>

	<p>It&rsquo;d be easier for me to write this piece as an ode to Beyonc&eacute; rather than an open letter to you. Beyonc&eacute;, the woman who used her time on a national stage to inspire black folks to feel unapologetic about their heritage, their appearance and to continue to challenge authority. Today, Beyonc&eacute; is that artist for me.</p>

	<p>A few years ago, though, I would have said the same for you.</p>

	<p>When people talk about Old Kanye versus New Kanye, I think less in terms of albums but rather in terms of Katrina-era and Kardashian-era. I think that this is more indicative of your life, and what will ultimately be your legacy.</p>

	<p>One day, your heroes became white men. You admired Steve Jobs, Walt Disney. You took off the Louis Vuitton backpack you used to wear and fashioned it into a lifestyle, pushing your way into fashion houses and runways, crying alienation when they wouldn&rsquo;t let you in. When they didn&rsquo;t give you a key to the boy&rsquo;s club. You gave a white man permission to use &ldquo;Last Niggas in Paris&rdquo; as a part of his collection. You co-signed making our oppression trendy.</p>

		<p>I stanned for you, &lsquo;Ye. Not in the passive way that I admire Jimi Hendrix or Michael Jackson by virtue of who they are and what they&rsquo;ve done, I mean I really stanned for you. I still listen to College Dropout on wax. I bought your records and recited your lyrics to the envy of all of my elementary school friends. I, with what little knowledge I had of politics or social inequality, somehow knew that when you said, &ldquo;George Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about black people&rdquo;, that it was truth. I regarded your word as law. And maybe that was where I went wrong.</p>

	<p>You see, Kanye, at the end of the day, you&rsquo;re just a man. You live and breathe, you say things you regret, you take them back, you create, you destroy, and you will die as humans do. Somewhere along the line, I think that even you forgot that you were mortal. Somehow, between the gleam of Kardashian and the check from Adidas, you began to think that you were impervious to criticism, that you were above reproach. You claimed that you were an OG, the greatest artist of all time and in the process, somehow became more &ldquo;Twitter fingers&rdquo; than Meek.</p>

	<p>The thing is though, you attacked a man&rsquo;s (ex)wife and child on Twitter the other day and that&rsquo;s where I drew the line. You slut-shamed a woman for the same qualities you loved her for once.</p>
	<p> You continue to praise your non-black wife for the traits she appropriated from us, black women, while simultaneously implying that we should be ashamed for the same sensuality, the same autonomy that Kim seems to have. But then again, you told us a long time ago that &ldquo;when he get on, he&rsquo;ll leave your ass for a white girl&rdquo;. So perhaps I&rsquo;m to blame for believing otherwise.</p>

	<p>Do you still talk about Chicago the way you once did, in terms of resilience and struggle and beauty in a world that aims to erase it? Do you still think about the kid who wasn&rsquo;t supposed to make it past 25? </p>

	<p>Is that narrative still in you? </p>

	<p>Kanye West sat next to Jay Leno on the Tonight Show and tried to rationalize the irrational. He struggled to joke back with Leno&rsquo;s attempts to diffuse the situation. He fidgeted with his hair during an awkward silence.</p>

	<p>One day earlier, West had taken the microphone from Taylor Swift and proclaimed her victory at the MTV Video Music Awards a mistake. But in this moment, West sat in front of millions of viewers with regret.</p>

	<p>He felt bad because he had hurt a person he considered talented. He said he had always wanted to help people in life and admitted his actions were wrong.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;It was rude,&rdquo; West said. &ldquo;Period.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Then Leno asked West what his recently deceased mother would have thought of the incident. Over the prior two years, West had lost his mother, broken up with his fiancee and released an album that people didn&rsquo;t appreciate.</p>

	<p>West looked down and thought about how to answer the question. Twenty seconds passed before he said a word.</p>

	<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what he did. He vanished from the public world for nearly two years and created a masterpiece.</p>

	<p>It&rsquo;s easy for people to look into the actions of West and purely see the narcissistic ego-maniac who talks in nonsense and craves attention. It&rsquo;s easy to see an asshole.</p>

	<p>Maybe he is just that, but the roots of West&rsquo;s actions are often misunderstood.</p>

	<p>Kanye West is the rock star that most die-hard music nerds would be if they became rock stars. He cares so much about the concept of culture and how society evaluates it that he sometimes loses his mind. He absolutely plays a calculated character, but the type of character he likely loved growing up. He&rsquo;s a nerd.</p>

	<p>One of the biggest keys to understanding West &mdash; coming from someone who has never met West and pretends to understand him &mdash; is that he ignited the sensitive rap generation.</p>

	<p>In a time of gangster rap, West took paint classes at the American Academy of Art and shortly studied English at Chicago State University. While most rappers come up as teenagers and are stars before they can legally drink, West grinded for six years as a producer before being signed as a rapper.</p>

	<p>His insane intensity may not stem from a drug-oriented youth or coming from poverty. He was raised in a middle-class environment, but he had to persevere through each and every stigma and creating an identity in music that had yet to be seen.</p>

</div>

<div class="row article">
	<div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-5 body-copy">

	<p>West is an emotional romantic. People often confuse his blatant honesty as him being worse than any other person. Everyone is a mess. We all do incredibly stupid things. He just isn&rsquo;t afraid to speak specifically about sending girls pictures of his junk or his massive ego.</p>

	<p>Most of his seemingly unforgivable actions come from more than ego, though. They come from caring so much about a thing we also care so much about &mdash; music.</p>

	<p>He&rsquo;s the kind of guy who stopped by the Rolling Stone offices to explain to them what an album meant. Yes, maybe now he is someone who shows no emotion and calculates each public move he makes.</p>

	<p>But that withdrawal from the public comes from being so worn down by being so damn hated for every action he did which all came from caring, a lot.</p>

	<p>In that same interview with Leno, he spoke about wanting to help Swift move on from the incident. He tried to open up about trying to be a better person.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I want to live this thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard sometimes."</p>

	<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s useless to question Kanye West&rsquo;s long-tried fashion career.</p>

	<p>Yes, he promoted a line over the course of four years that never saw the light of day. Yes, he created not one, but two whole collections of pantyhose bodysuits in the same calendar year. And yes, he once classified his style as being, &ldquo;50 percent rock 'n' roll, 50 percent hip-hop, 50 percent genius.&rdquo;   Nevertheless, as questionable as West&rsquo;s sartorial exploits have been through his 10-year stint, we all still seem to care, as can be seen by the instantaneous sell out of the Yeezy Season 3 show scheduled for this afternoon.</p>

	<p>There is an understood set of rules for celebrities-turned-designers, which typically most adhere to during their brief fashion ventures. </p>

		<p>Over these past 10 years, West has broken every single one of them: crowding other designers out of their fashion week time slots, publicly bashing the industry&rsquo;s top critics and announcing his collections just weeks before their arrival like a Beyonc&eacute; world tour.</p>

		<p>Even still, West has garnered considerate recognition for what his designs deserve, questioning if anyone can break into the fashion industry as long as he has mastered one element: spectacle, an art we&rsquo;ve seen time and time again in both his music and fashion careers. </p>

	<p>In 2008 when West released the much anticipated &ldquo;808s &amp; Heartbreak,&rdquo; his transition to electropop influences wasn&rsquo;t initially welcomed. </p>

	<p>While his success from &ldquo;Graduation&rdquo; had anchored him a strong spot in the music industry, he chose to shift gears, producing more minimalistic sounds with the usage of new Auto-Tune and 808 drum technology.</p>

	<div class="show-mobile"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet show-mobile" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ fitting <a href="https://t.co/dVS7sedQVH">pic.twitter.com/dVS7sedQVH</a></p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/696813552020123648">February 8, 2016</a></blockquote>
	<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

	<p>This move hit controversy, but West simultaneously found spectacle, ranking number one on the Billboard 200 and gaining platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. </p>

	<p>Much in the same way, spectacle has become an essential in West&rsquo;s fashion career.</p>

	<p>Fashion shows don&rsquo;t normally feature drill sergeants commanding models to march along the runway. In turn, models don&rsquo;t usually shuffle along catwalks smoking cigarettes or fidgeting with their hair.</p>

	<p>Oddities as they are, these were the spectacles which ruffled fashion&rsquo;s feathers in West&rsquo;s past seasons.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;This second round of drab, broken-down basics proved he can&rsquo;t be taken seriously as a designer, but nevertheless many people in fashion do seem to take West seriously &mdash; they keep showing up expectantly for his performances,&rdquo; critic Kathy Horyn wrote in The Cut after seeing West&rsquo;s Yeezy Season 2 last fall. </p>

	<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

	<p>Designers don&rsquo;t rent out Madison Square Garden&rsquo;s 18,200 seats for a fall line. Nor do they hire 1,200 cast members to participate in their show.</p>

	<p>Spectacles yet again, these are the exact plans of Yeezy Season 3, as West hinted on his Twitter account and an online casting call.</p>

	<p>Although the entire point of spectacle is to surprise the unassuming, it is quite fun to wonder what sort of show will be put on this afternoon.</p>

	<p>With 1200 models, maybe we can expect a flash mob of sorts. Not only could this make an interesting form of entertainment for the attendees, but could even become a viral YouTube video, if we&rsquo;re so lucky.</p>

		<p>And because West has revealed his next album will be gospel-focused, maybe today will become an evangelical event, definitely deserving spectacle status.</p>

		<p>Whatever the case, Yeezy Season 3 is bound to be a collection worth its hype, not necessarily for the clothes, but for the show we can&rsquo;t dream of expecting. </p>
